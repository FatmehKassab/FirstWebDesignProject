For my initial try into web design, I embarked on a project where I exclusively utilized margin properties, steering clear of flexbox. 
I developed my own architecture to suit my preferences, finding it more intuitive. The website serves as a platform for showcasing my interests and personality. 
To ensure responsiveness across various devices, I relied on media queries. In the construction process, I favored the use of IDs over classes, although I acknowledge that optimization wasn't a primary focus. 

In my future projects, I prioritize factors such as optimization, use of modern layout techniques like flexbox, and a more structured , ensuring a more polished and efficient final product.
